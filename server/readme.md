controllers: Define your app route handlers and business logic
routes: Define your app routes, with HTTP methods. For example, you can define everything related to the user.
models: also a kind of middleware between your controller and the database. You can define a schema and do some validation before writing to the database. For example, you can use an ORM like Mongoose which comes with great features and methods to use in the schema itself
